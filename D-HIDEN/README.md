# Hierarchical Decomposition of Dynamically Evolving Regulatory Networks

# Requirements:
> 1. OS: Ubuntu 12.04 or later.
> 2. Matlab: R2014a or later.

# How to use:
> 1. Run cond_topo_dist.m to generate models under cond_topo_dist folder.
> 2. Run cond_topo_dist_combine.m to combine the models under cond_topo_dist folder.
> 3. Run joint_perb_dist.m to generate models under joint_perb_dist folder.
> 4. Run joint_perb_dist_combination.m to combine models under joint_perb_dist folder.
> 5. Call dynamic_hiden function to compute hierarchical decomposition.

#Comments:
The step (1) to (4) is optional, since we have created these models for you under the model folder. </br>
If you determine the use our models, please copy these models to the same folder with codes.
